In 2018, I sold a limited run of it at <a class="nearr" href="http://www.beguilingbooksandart.com" target="_blank">The Beguiling.</a> I kinda just went crazy with it and tried to have fun making something short, but I don’t know if it holds up well.</p><p>Set in 2432 AD, 24 32 follows a twenty-something cat and her talking Roomba as they get bored and go on the Dark Web. This leads to limb amputation, nudity, swearing, and a really annoying anime catgirl.</p><figure><img src="img/zine.jpg"/><figcaption>The zine.</figcaption></figure><p>For 24 32’s art, I decided to break away from my then-usual style of illustration and aim for shitty MS Paint-ish crudeness. The book’s layout and typography are a nightmare—no defined backgrounds, dialogue and interactions that regularly break the expected reading flow, and a mess of awful and expensive typeface choices.</p><p>A sequel named 48 64 was planned but never released… however I am working on a much larger graphic novel project named Micromissile—stay tuned.</p></div></body></html>

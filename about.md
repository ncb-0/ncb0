- my initials are M-N-M… i’m trans so OBVIOUSLY i took that opportunity…  
- i speak tiny bits of japanese, mandarin, and russian… but my adhd ass will probably never become fluent in any of them lol
- “ncb0” is a weird shortening of “nekorobotto” that i came up with during an episode… somehow it stuck… “nez/nezu” is another online nick of mine…
- ncb0 was SUPPOSED to be pronounced “nekobo” or “nekbo” but it quickly became “enceebio” after a friend started calling me that lol
- [follow my partner!!](https://twitter.com/matushkasobak) he dope af… also [this pokemon](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Meltan_(Pokemon)) seems to be named after us
- this website was written almost entirely by hand… i hate site builders lul… the fonts are also all custom… this all goes for my other sites too if u know where to find them
